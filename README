Snowy is Tomboy's best friend online.

Snowy is a web-based viewer for your Tomboy notes written in Django.

Snowy was written a long time ago and development has ceased. But now you can
run it on OpenShift.

Create a new application of type Python 2.7. Tell it to use
https://github.com/jaredjennings/snowy.git as the code to begin from. Tell it
to use PostgreSQL 9.2 as the database. Once your app is deployed, you'll need
to rhc ssh into it, and run manage.py createsuperuser. Once you have a Django
superuser, you can visit https://yourappname-yourdomain.rhcloud.com/admin, use
the superuser login, and create yourself a normal user under Users. Then tell
your Tomboy, Tomdroid or Conboy to use your new server to sync with!
